# Digital Delta Eco specification

This specification describes the Digital Delta Eco API (DD-ECO-API). It is meant for both implementers and consumers of the Digital Delta Eco specifications.

## About the Digital Delta Eco specification

This specification defines a standardised method for retrieving (and providing) [ecological measurements](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/wiki/Ecological-Measurements).
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/wiki) for a full description.

## Getting Started

**The RAML specifications are now obsolete and are replaced by their OAS 3.x equivalents.**

A minimal version of the DD-ECO-API in OAS 3.x format can be viewed [here](http://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/master/Minimal%20DD-ECO-API.json).

An expanded version, as implemented by AquaDesk, can be viewed [here](http://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/master/FullFeaturedAquaDeskDefinition.json).

The [HTML specifications](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/tree/master/Html) can also be used and may be easier to read.

For testing, some [PostMan](https://getpostman.com) [scripts](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/tree/master/Postman%20Scripts) are supplied.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The easiest way to get the specification is to download the generated HTML files.
To be able to use the RAML files, please consult the [tools](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/wiki/Tools) section. Knowledge of the [RAML language](https://raml.org) is then recommended.

### Installing

The supplied code for the [.NET Filter Syntax Parser](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/tree/master/.NET%20Filter%20Syntax%20Parser) is written in C# with .NET Framework 4.6+.
A good environment for editing and compiling that solution, is [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15).

The unit tests are written in [NUnit](http://nunit.org/).
