# Digital Delta Eco API definitions.
Defines specifications for retrieving measurements and discovery of query parameters, specified in [RAML](https://raml.org).
This is a specialized version of the Digital Delta API, focusing on ecological data.

The directory PostMan Scripts contains a [PostMan](https://getpostman.com) 2.1 collection, with sample requests.
The AquaDesk Examples directory contains samples of query results from AquaDesk, which implements a complete set of Extended end-points.

HTML renders of the RAML specification are provided for easy reading.
These static [HTML pages](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/tree/master/Html) are generated with [RAML2HTML](https://github.com/raml2html). The Slate versions of the HTML pages allow searching and show types, but are much larger in size.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/wiki) for more details.
The [documentation.md](https://github.com/DigitaleDeltaOrg/dd-eco-api-specs/blob/master/Documentation.md) file also contains detailed descriptions of the API.
